# Admin

- Day Three followup
- CIF: [link](https://cif.nd.edu/)
- Hackathon 

## Hackathon Requirements

- By 9:30am:
  - create a team folder on shared Google Drive under "hackathon"
  - Add a file (GDoc, Word, .txt, etc.) names "team-details" with the following information:
    - Team name
    - All team member names
    - Proposed data set(s), with links to online locations
      - If the data is not online, mention this (e.g. company data)
- By 10:30am:
  - Your team should have enough insights to get started on the presentation. 
    - You can divide and conquer in order to keep working with the data, but make sure you don't leave the presentation too late
- By 11:15ish:
  - Presentation time!
  - The exact start time will depend on the number of teams
  - 3 minutes to present (hard stop at 3 minutes), 1 minute for questions
    - Briefly introduce yourselves and your data
    - Focus on the insights you obtained from your wrangling
    - Briefly mention wragling techniques (these can be covered during questions as well)
- By 12:15
  - Upload to your team folder on GDrive:
    - presentation file (PDF, powerpoint, etc.)
    - supplemental file that includes R code for data import, wrangling, visualization, etc.

## Data sets

Where are they?

How do I find them? 

How do I download them? 

Possible sources of inspiration:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/) 
- [Text data!](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets) 
- [R packages that implement data sets](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3109890/these-r-packages-import-sports-weather-stock-data-and-more.html)
- [Possibly outdated list of R sports data (but a good place to start) packages](https://www.r-bloggers.com/sports-data-and-r-scope-for-a-thematic-rather-than-task-view-living-post/)


Just a note on the last two links above, if you are using data that is alreay loaded in an R package, that is (potentially) fine, but I'll expect that there will be extra work on the downstream tasks to make up for the fact that the data is already in R. 

## Your turn

### Logistics

- Groups: between 2-5 members, but if you have a compelling case for going solo, let me know
- Data: You'll need something to wrangle
- Objective: a 3-minute presentation on your data set, what you set out to learn from it, what you did learn, and how you went about learning it.
- Most important: If you can apply the methods from this week to some data that interests you, I will consider this week a success.

For your presentation you can present:

- Slides (Powerpoint OR pdf slides from an Rmd document)
- knitted Rmd document

Presentations should include:

- Team name
- Team members' names
- Data set introduction
- Wrangling performed (conceptual as well as tools used)
- Final insight (tables, plots, etc.)
