## Welcome

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R!
During the next four days, we are going to cover a significant amount of data wrangling. 
While we will not cover every single data wrangling technique, we will cover enough that you should feel confident when tricky data situations land on your lap. 
We will be using R and RStudio to do our work during the week. 
With regard to data, we will be using built-in data and data from other sources for our demonstrations and exercises. 
You might even have some data of your own that you want to bring in to work on -- I support this 100%.
 

## Getting The Most From The Week

As previously noted, we will cover many techniques in this course. 
I am here merely to be your guide on this journey into the heart of data wrangling; to that end, the majority of our time will be spent working on code. 
After every topic is introduced, you will have the opportunity to try things out. 
Please take this opportunity to work through the code and experiment -- it is truly the only way to learn how to wrangle data. 

The more you interact with the code, the more you will understand how it works and how you can combine functions to make data bend to your will. 
Work alone, in groups, ask me for help, or anything else to play with the material -- just interact with it!

## Daily Checks

At the end of every day, you will be given one data wrangling problem -- you will not need to provide any code for these assignments. 
Instead, your mission is to explain how you would solve the wrangling problem. 
Coding is very important and you will be doing plenty of it, but a big part of data wrangling is creating the mental map for what you are doing and how you are going to get there.

Your job is to explain how to get from here:

Use these daily checks to start practicing how to build your mental data wrangling palace.

## Hackathon
While not, strictly speaking, an assessment, our last day together is going to be a hackathon. 
You will get into groups of 3 to 5 people, choose a data set, cobble it into some shape, and give a brief presentation. 
The probability of some breakfast treat appearing is incredibly close to 1.  

### A few notes on the hackathon

- You will be picking your own groups for the hackathon. Because we are only together for a week, I'm relying on you to form groups where members have a good complement of skills. 
- Because of the schedule, I encourage each group to form early and think about possible data sets early as well. A rough outline for the week might look like what's outlined below. That said, nothing is set in stone with regards to the hackathon before Thursday. 
  - Monday: Form groups
  - Tuesday: Identify and explore potential data sets
  - Wednesday: Formulate a project plan for Thursday
  - Thursday: Hack! 
- The hackathon outputs will be considered **group work.** I expect each group member to contribute to the final output. 

## Course Feedback 

Although we are only together for a week, I want to make sure that the course goes well for everyone. 
To that end, I've set up an anonymous feedback form online, available at the following link: 

[**Click here to access the feedback form**](https://forms.gle/btqy3dUthj9V1jZX9)

Please use the form to list any comments, concerns, etc. with regards to the class. 
I will check the form responses each day and, if necessary, address them the following morning. 
If there are things that you like, let me know!
If there are things that you do not like, let me know!
Real-time feedback will allow me to update the class so that you can benefit from the changes, along with students who will take the class in future semesters.
